# ep_autoscrolldown

Add a checkbox to auto scroll down the pad when content is modified. No setting required. Both read-write and read-only modes.

## About
This module is part of an academic project for courses accessibility from Paris 8 University (France).

I use already loaded JQuery library and EPL hooks.

## To do
- Improve button style...
- Adding some optional settings like "restrict function to a mode : read-write|read-only".

## Bugs
After You uncheck the option, some browsers need several click/scroll in the pad to deactive autoscroll ! I don't know why for now...

Send me an email if You found a bug, and please specify your browser version (You can use www.html5test.com to retrieve the correct browser name/version).
